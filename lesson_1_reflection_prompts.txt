How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Narrows your focus to only things that have actually changed. Filter out
    noise.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you compile and save often you can always go back to a version that
    doesn't have a bug or more easily find the bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you can commit after making new logical blocks and logical endings.
    Cons: you can forget to commit or if you are on a team and a teammate is not
    responsible they could create problems by leaving lots of lines to hunt for
    bugs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Perhaps because often in coding with a large project you are working with
    multiple files that depend on one another and you should always commit them
    together, even if you only changed some of the interdependent files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    not sure, because I haven't learned about these yet.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always reset or undo any changes. your work is always safe
    from specific points in time.
    You have a way to focus in on what changes actually made the break and go
    back to a version of all files without the break.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to eventually set up a hub for my ART : - )

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    You can use git log to see all of the commits and if the tags are good
    descriptors, you can use git diff to see the specific changes between two
    files.
