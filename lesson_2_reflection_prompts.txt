What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialize a repository, git now has a space to track your files
  and editing history. You need to do this before you can do any commits

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  If you aren't sure if a new idea will create bugs, it will be better in an
  experimental branch. Or perhaps you want to experiment with two different ways
  to do the same thing.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  The commits can be viewed as nodes on a directed graph, and it is important to
  see which commits you can actually see from given branch/commit
